# Monarch-Migration-Timing

## Title

Examining effects of climate change on timing and duration of migration through analysis of protected area datasets.

## Purpose

Analyze the fall migration data at Long Point to determin how the timing of (peak-) migration or variability around this peak/migration season length varies with annual weather conditions or has changed through time with changes in climatic conditions. The results will describe both drivers of inter-annual variability in timing and migration season length as well as any climate induced changes in Monarch fall migration patterns at Long Point.
